title: An Introduction To LibreHealth
---


LibreHealth is an amazing collaborative community for free and open source software projects in Health IT and also a member project of Software Freedom Conservancy. What makes LibreHealth different from others? Well, LibreHealth works in Medical fields providing open source projects in Health IT. Currently it has three projects. Let us get introduced to these projects!

## 1.LibreHealth Toolkit:

The toolkit software acts like a data model for many other Health IT applications. It is easy to install and use. Scalable is one of the features of toolkit as it runs on Windows, Linux and OSX. It also runs on mobile, desktop and laptops. Toolkit is built for quick healthcare and is used by clinicians, nurses and even midwives. It is available in eight different languages. LibreHealth Toolkit currently has two versions- LibreHealth Toolkit LTS 1.12.0 and LibreHealth Toolkit LTS 2.0.0. Again, the Toolkit has a powerful rest API that can be assembled by non-developers to create health information systems. It is transparent and open and the LibreHealth team welcomes a diverse community of the individuals who want to improve healthcare. 

## 2.LibreHealth EHR:

LibreHealth EHR (Electronic Health Record) application is clinically-focused electronic health record system. It is designed to be both easy to use and customizable in a variety of health care settings. It builds on the strength of LibreHealth Toolkit and designed to be an easy-to-use experience for healthcare professionals.

## 3.LibreHealth Radiology:

LibreHealth Radiology is a customized version of LibreHealth Toolkit with additional tools and is an open source radiology information system which manages the clinical workflow of a Radiology department. The module aims at adding capabilities of a Radiology Information System into LibreHealth Toolkit. The objectives include identifying radiology’s department workflow according to radiology experts, designing an architecture that supports basic radiology’s department services and satisfying module’s quality parameters set by community. Again, current set of features include placing radiology orders, creating radiology report once a radiology order is completed and much more. Though the module is not released, but the LibreHealth Team is working very hard on first release.

LibreHealth community is a meritocracy and focuses on development and design of technology that will have measurable impact on the health of people. Being an umbrella organization, multiple health information technology projects collaborate in this community. LibreHealth is driven by real needs of patients and all discussions, project plans, designs and other artifacts are searchable and easily accessible to everyone.
